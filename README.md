# The-Combat-Robotics-Project

My senior project is to design and build a fighting robot for an international competition in the spring of 2017. The competition is similar to boxing where two robots compete in a head to head match following its basics in attempt to disable the other robot. For this event I will be competing in the lightweight class where the competitors are limited to three pounds for their robotâ€™s construction. I will also be using a radio transmitter and receiver to control my robot from a safe distance.

After extensive research on effective robots in past competitions, I was able to come up with a design that I believe would work well throughout the competition. After multiple sketching multiple designs to figure out the most efficient layout for the internal components, I was able to transfer my design into a CAD (computer aided design) software to further plan out the construction of my robot. This allowed me to observe any mechanical difficulties while constructing the robot as well as creat a rendering of the final design.  Currently I am converting the frame components of of my computer aided design into CNC (computer numerical code) files to be cut out of aluminium on our CNC machine. While the calibration of the CNC machine has been more difficult than I initially anticipated, I have been able to cut prototype versions of my frame out of plywood and hope to have the aluminum components cut by mid January of 2017.
